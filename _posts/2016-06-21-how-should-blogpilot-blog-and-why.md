# How should BlogPilot blog? and why?

What is to be the supreme purpose of our own blog?

That is the question we've been asking ourselves...but we've been having a bit of difficulty. 

The internet is absolutely plastered with meta entrepreneurs right now. I.e. entrepreneurs teaching entrepreneurs how to do thing. 

* "How to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_"
* "The ultimate guide to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_"
* "17 simple steps to producing massive \_\_\_\_\_\_"

Bored yet?

We don't want to bore you. There is amazing content all over the internet that will help you start an online business, and even create some world-class content marketing.

## Where should we fall in?

We could spend hours and hours every single day, working on bringing you epic "how-to" posts and creating "ultimate guides"...but do you really need more of that?

The individuals we aim to serve...online business owners and bloggers who struggle with making a dent through content marketing...what do they really want and need from us?
